Scripts and programs for measure seeing

PSC is main script for measurmaents. It has options after import block, and if star does not detected coorectly, I recommend chandge FWHM. Also it can show the britest star, if check needed. This script write two file types: fits files with image of star for later process and csv file with measured seeing.

cam-viewer is script for checking polaris position during camera installation.
